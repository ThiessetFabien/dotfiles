# Tailwind Snippets

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It is becoming popular day by day. So we should adopt it on our project. But some beginners faced problems when they tried to use it for first time. So I have developed this extension. This extension will help you to build website faster than ever. You will get all necessary sections and components for your website. Just you have to write a shortcut and VS Code will suggest you the code.
